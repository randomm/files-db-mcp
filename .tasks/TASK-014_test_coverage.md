# TASK-014: Improve Test Coverage for Claude MCP Integration

## Description
This task focuses on improving test coverage for the Claude MCP integration component (`claude_mcp.py`), which previously had 0% test coverage according to the latest coverage report. The goal is to achieve at least 75% test coverage for this module through comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Objectives
- ✅ Write unit tests for the Claude MCP implementation
- ✅ Create integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality
- ✅ Ensure proper test fixtures for MCP protocol testing
- ✅ Test error handling and edge cases

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Test coverage for `claude_mcp.py` reaches at least 75% (achieved 85%)
- ✅ All MCP endpoint handlers are tested
- ✅ Error handling scenarios are covered
- ✅ Tests follow existing project test patterns and conventions

## Implementation Details
1. ✅ Create mock MCP client/server testing utilities
2. ✅ Develop tests for all MCP function handlers
3. ✅ Implement tests for error scenarios and edge cases
4. ✅ Validate response formats match expected MCP protocol

## Dependencies
- Existing test suite and fixtures
- PyTest and pytest-cov for coverage tracking

## Priority
Medium

## Status
✅ COMPLETED

## Actual Effort
5 hours

## Completion Date
2025-03-23

## Notes
Achieved 85% coverage for claude_mcp.py, exceeding the 75% target.
Improved overall project coverage from 20% to 68%.
