# Integrate with Claude Code via MCP

## Description
Create a standard MCP integration with Claude Code to allow seamless interaction between the files-db-mcp system and Claude's AI capabilities. This will enable users to leverage the vector search capabilities directly within Claude Code sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement MCP interface compatible with Claude Code specifications
- [x] Create a registration process for the MCP tool in Claude Code
- [x] Expose vector search functionality through the MCP interface
- [x] Support passing of search parameters and results between Claude and files-db-mcp
- [x] Create simple documentation for using the MCP tool in Claude Code
- [x] Test the integration with a sample project within Claude Code
- [x] Ensure proper handling of errors and edge cases
- [x] Add examples of common search patterns in the documentation

## Related Tasks
- TASK-003: Create MCP interface with stdio support (completed, foundation for this work)
- TASK-016: Fix Docker Compose environment (prerequisite for stable MCP integration)

## Notes
- Claude Code requires tools to be registered as MCPs following their specification
- The integration will leverage the existing MCP interface but extend it for Claude Code compatibility
- This feature will improve accessibility of the vector search functionality without requiring explicit Docker setup
- The implementation can learn from examples like ezyang/codemcp and auchenberg/claude-code-mcp
- The MCP tool will need to handle proper input/output formatting according to Claude Code expectations
