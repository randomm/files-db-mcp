# Sprint 1: Core Infrastructure with Zero-Configuration Setup

Sprint Dates: 2025-03-22 - 2025-04-05

## Sprint Goals
- Set up the core infrastructure for the Files-DB-MCP project with focus on zero-configuration
- Implement one-command Docker Compose environment for instant deployment
- Create auto-starting file indexing system with real-time file monitoring
- Establish MCP interface foundation for seamless tool integration
- Enable developers to start using the system in any project with minimal effort
- Ensure the index stays up-to-date as developers modify their codebase

## Selected Backlog Items

- [x] TASK-001: Set up one-command Docker Compose environment (High, 5 points) - COMPLETED
- [x] TASK-002: Implement auto-starting file indexing system (High, 8 points) - IN PROGRESS
- [x] TASK-003: Create MCP interface with stdio support (High, 8 points) - COMPLETED
- [x] TASK-004: Implement basic vector search capabilities (High, 8 points) - COMPLETED
- [x] TASK-012: Implement one-line installation and startup command (High, 5 points) - COMPLETED

## Technical Decisions

- Vector database selection: Will evaluate Qdrant vs Milvus for the initial implementation
- Embedding model: Start with a lightweight open source model from Hugging Face suitable for code embeddings
- Sentence Transformers framework for handling embeddings with quantization and binary options
- Python for core implementation due to rich ecosystem for vector databases and NLP
- Docker Compose for easy local deployment and testing

## Sprint Risk Assessment
- Vector database performance with large codebases - Mitigate with progressive indexing and prioritizing most relevant files first
- MCP integration complexity - Research current MCP standards thoroughly before implementation
- Embedding quality for code files - Test with diverse code samples and adjust chunking strategy
- Zero-configuration startup challenges - Use extensive auto-detection for project type and sensible defaults
- Initial indexing time - Implement background indexing while allowing immediate querying of already-indexed files

## Definition of Done
- Code passes all tests
- Documentation is updated
- Features can be demonstrated
- Docker Compose setup works on a fresh clone
- MCP interface can be used by a client application
