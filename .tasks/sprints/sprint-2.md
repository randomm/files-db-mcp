# Sprint 2: Enhanced Features and Quality

Sprint Dates: 2025-04-06 - 2025-04-20

## Sprint Goals
- Implement SSE support for real-time progress updates and streaming responses
- Add advanced search capabilities with filters for more targeted searches
- Support configurable embedding models with quantization and binary options
- Implement enhanced code quality with linting, testing, and CI/CD integration
- Optimize performance for large codebases with incremental indexing

## Selected Backlog Items

- [x] TASK-005: Add SSE support to MCP interface (Medium, 5 points) - COMPLETED
- [x] TASK-008: Add advanced search filters (Medium, 5 points) - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] TASK-010: Support for configurable open source embedding models (Medium, 8 points)
- [ ] TASK-007: Implement incremental indexing (Medium, 5 points)
- [x] TASK-013: Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure (Medium, 5 points) - IN PROGRESS
- [x] TASK-014: Add code quality tools and linting (Medium, 3 points) - IN PROGRESS
- [x] TASK-015: Create CI/CD pipeline with Docker (Medium, 5 points) - IN PROGRESS

## Technical Decisions

- SSE Implementation: Use FastAPI with asyncio for event streaming
- Search Filters: Support multiple filter types (file type, path, date) with efficient query construction
- Embedding Models: Focus on Hugging Face models optimized for code with quantization options
- Incremental Indexing: Use file modification timestamps and checksums for efficient updates
- Testing: Implement pytest with coverage reports and both unit and integration tests
- Code Quality: Use black, isort, ruff, and mypy with pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions workflow with docker-compose.ci.yml

## Sprint Risk Assessment
- Performance with large codebases - Mitigate with efficient indexing algorithms and pagination
- Resource usage with multiple embedding models - Implement model unloading when not in use
- Testing complexity - Create comprehensive fixtures and mocks for deterministic testing
- Integration complexity with streaming responses - Implement clear protocol documentation

## Definition of Done
- All code is formatted and linted according to project standards
- Unit tests cover at least 80% of new code
- Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality
- Documentation is updated to reflect new features
- All functions have proper type annotations and docstrings
- CI pipeline passes for all changes
