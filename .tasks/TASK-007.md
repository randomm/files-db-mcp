# TASK-007: Implement Incremental Indexing

## Status: COMPLETE

## Description

Implement incremental indexing to improve performance for large codebases. Instead of re-indexing all files on startup, only process files that have been added, modified, or deleted since the last indexing operation.

## Implementation Details

- [x] Add file metadata tracking (hashes, modification times, sizes)
- [x] Implement efficient file change detection
- [x] Add incremental indexing mode (default) with full reindex option
- [x] Update MCP interface to expose reindexing controls
- [x] Add CLI option for forcing full reindex
- [x] Handle deleted files properly

## Technical Notes

The implementation uses the following approach:

1. **File Metadata Tracking**:
   - Store file hashes, modification times, and sizes in state file
   - Compute SHA-256 hash for text files (with size limit for performance)
   - For large files, use size+mtime combination as a proxy for content hash

2. **Change Detection Algorithm**:
   - On startup, scan all files in project directory
   - Compare against previously indexed files to find:
     - New files to add
     - Modified files to update (based on hash/mtime/size)
     - Deleted files to remove
   - Only process files that need updating

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Skip hash computation for large files (>10MB)
   - Process files in parallel with thread pool
   - Early filtering of ignored files and directories
   - Efficient state file management

4. **API Enhancements**:
   - Added `trigger_reindex` MCP command to force reindexing
   - Added `get_indexing_status` MCP command to check progress
   - Added proper metadata handling in vector storage

5. **CLI Options**:
   - Added `--force-reindex` flag to command line interface
   - Incremental indexing is enabled by default

## Benefits

- Significantly faster startup times for large codebases
- Reduced system resource usage during indexing
- Better handling of large files
- More accurate change detection
- User control over indexing behavior

## Limitations

- File change detection outside the application requires file system events
- Large binary files still rely on mtime/size instead of content hash
- State file can grow large for repositories with many files
