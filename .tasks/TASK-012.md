# TASK-012: Fix Test Suite Issues

## Description
The test suite has several failures that need to be addressed:

1. File permission errors in file_processor tests
2. Asyncio-related issues in SSE interface tests
3. Linting errors across multiple files

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Fix file_processor tests to handle file permissions properly
- [ ] Set up proper asyncio environment for SSE tests
- [ ] Resolve all linting errors identified by ruff
- [ ] All tests pass on CI

## Technical Notes
- File permission issues are likely due to trying to create mock directories with insufficient permissions
- SSE tests need proper async fixture setup with pytest-asyncio
- Linting should be fixed with `ruff --fix` and manual fixes for the remaining issues

## Dependencies
- TASK-005: SSE Support
- TASK-010: Configurable Embedding Models

## Estimated Effort
Small (1-2 hours)

## Priority
High - Blocking proper CI/CD pipeline functionality
