# TASK-013: Improving Test Coverage - Completion Report

## Summary
Task to improve the test coverage of the Files-DB-MCP codebase has been completed. The overall test coverage has been increased from 45% to 69%, with significant improvements in key components:

- **file_watcher.py**: From 0% to 100% coverage
- **sse_interface.py**: From 49% to 61% coverage

## Implemented Tests

### 1. File Watcher Tests
Created comprehensive test suite for the file_watcher.py module, including:
- Tests for both FileChangeHandler and FileWatcher classes
- Event handling tests for file creation, modification, deletion, and moving
- Error handling tests for start() and stop() methods
- Tests for ignored path patterns

### 2. SSE Interface Tests
Added tests for previously uncovered functionality:
- broadcast() method for sending messages to all connected clients
- send_notification() method for targeting specific clients
- close_all_connections() method for proper cleanup
- _cleanup_connection() method for individual connection cleanup
- Error handling in _perform_search()

## Current Coverage Status

| Module | Previous Coverage | Current Coverage |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| file_watcher.py | 0% | 100% |
| sse_interface.py | 49% | 61% |
| file_processor.py | 78% | 78% |
| mcp_interface.py | 75% | 75% |
| vector_search.py | 81% | 81% |
| main.py | 0% | 0% |
| **Overall** | **45%** | **69%** |

## Remaining Coverage Gaps

1. **SSE Interface**: 
   - Route handlers and event generator implementation (requires HTTP testing)
   - Background task for indexing progress updates

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Several integration tests are failing due to mock configuration issues
   - Need to update mock behavior for SentenceTransformer and QdrantClient

3. **main.py**: 
   - Currently no coverage for the main application entry point
   - Would require tests that initialize the entire application

## Next Steps

To further improve test coverage:

1. Address the failed integration tests by fixing mock configuration issues
2. Create tests for main.py using FastAPI test client
3. Add more integration tests that combine multiple components
4. Improve SSE interface testing with HTTP client tests for route handlers

## Conclusion

The improvements made for TASK-013 have substantially increased the test coverage of the codebase. The file_watcher.py module now has 100% test coverage, and the SSE interface coverage has been significantly improved. These enhancements will help ensure the reliability and maintainability of these critical components.
