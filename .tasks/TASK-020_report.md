# TASK-020 Completion Report: Repository Structure Cleanup for Elegant, Minimal Structure

## Summary
The repository structure has been successfully reorganized to create a more elegant, minimal, and professional structure. The root directory now contains only the essential files while the rest of the files have been moved to appropriate directories. This makes the codebase more navigable, maintainable, and better aligned with the tool's purpose as a lightweight utility.

## Changes Implemented

### Directory Structure Reorganization
- Created organized directory structure:
  - `/src` - Source code files
  - `/tests` - Test files
  - `/docs` - Documentation
  - `/scripts` - Utility scripts
  - `/install` - Installation scripts
  - `/.docker` - Docker configuration files
  - `/config` - Configuration files
  - `/ai-assist` - AI assistance files

### File Movement and Reorganization
- Moved Docker-related files to `/.docker/`:
  - `Dockerfile.test`
  - `docker-compose.ci.yml` 
  - `.dockerignore`
- Consolidated installation scripts to `/install/`:
  - `install.sh`
  - `setup.sh`
- Moved configuration files to `/config/`:
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Moved utility scripts to `/scripts/`:
  - `run.sh`
  - `Makefile` (as reference)
- Moved AI assistant guidelines to `/ai-assist/`:
  - `CLAUDE.md`

### Root Directory Cleanup
- Reduced root directory to essential files:
  - `README.md` - Main documentation
  - `LICENSE` - Added MIT license
  - `pyproject.toml` - Python package configuration
  - `Dockerfile` - Main container definition
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Main deployment configuration
  - `files-db-mcp` - Primary executable script
  - Created symlinks for backwards compatibility

### Documentation and Configuration Updates
- Created a simplified, elegant README with concise instructions
- Updated file references in configuration files 
- Updated GitHub workflow to use new file locations
- Created a clean, dedicated installation process
- Updated .gitignore to ignore more temporary/cache files

## Verification
- Verified correct file organization and structure
- Confirmed symlinks and references work correctly
- Validated Docker build process with new structure

## Impact
1. **Improved Organization**: Files are now logically grouped in dedicated directories
2. **Reduced Root Clutter**: Root directory contains only essential files
3. **Better Documentation**: Simplified, focused README and documentation
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to navigate and maintain the codebase
5. **Professional Structure**: Repository layout follows best practices

## Next Steps
1. Continue with remaining beta release tasks
2. Update any reference documentation that might need updating
3. Consider further simplification of installation process

The repository is now well-organized and follows a clean, professional structure that better reflects the tool's purpose as an elegant, minimal utility.
