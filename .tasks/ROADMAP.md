# Project Roadmap: Files-DB-MCP
Last Updated: 2025-03-22

## Version History
- v1.0 (2025-03-22) - Initial roadmap

## Strategic Vision
Build a local vector database system for software project files that enables LLM coding agents to efficiently search through codebases via MCP interface, significantly improving code understanding and search capabilities. The system should provide an effortless setup experience for developers joining existing projects, with immediate indexing and search capabilities through a simple startup command in any project directory.

## Success Metrics
- Installation time: < 1 minute for existing project setup
- Time to first results: < 30 seconds after container startup 
- Query response time: < 500ms for typical file searches
- Integration: Seamless MCP integration with Claude Code, Cursor, and similar tools
- Zero-configuration: Automatic detection and indexing of project files
- Reliability: > 99% uptime during development sessions

## Timeline Overview
Phase 1 - Core Functionality: Vector DB Implementation and Basic MCP Interface
Phase 2 - Enhanced Features: Advanced Search, Optimization, and Integration
Phase 3 - Robustness: Testing, Documentation, and Distribution

## Phase 1: Core Functionality
### Key Deliverables:
- One-command Docker Compose setup for instant deployment in any project directory
- Auto-detecting file indexing system with immediate start on container launch
- Continuous file monitoring for real-time updates to the index
- Basic MCP interface with stdio support
- Initial query capabilities (basic search by similarity)
- Zero-configuration startup for existing projects
- Background indexing with progressive result improvement

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features
### Key Deliverables:
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) support in MCP interface
- Advanced search capabilities (semantic search, filters)
- Incremental indexing for large codebases
- Performance optimizations
- Configuration options for open source Hugging Face embedding models
- Support for quantization and binary embeddings to improve storage efficiency
- Advanced indexing settings and algorithm selection

## Phase 3: Robustness
### Key Deliverables:
- Comprehensive test suite
- Full documentation (installation, usage, configuration)
- Easy installation process (script or CLI tool)
- Example integrations with common LLM tools
- Monitoring and diagnostics

## Risk Assessment
- Performance: Large codebases might slow down indexing and search - Mitigate with incremental indexing and optimization
- MCP Standard Changes: MCP protocol might evolve - Monitor changes and maintain compatibility
- Resource Usage: Vector DB might consume excessive resources - Implement resource limits and efficient storage
- Integration Complexity: Different LLM tools might require different integration approaches - Create flexible adapter system
