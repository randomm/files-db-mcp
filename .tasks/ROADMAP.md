# Project Roadmap: Files-DB-MCP
Last Updated: 2024-03-24

## Version History
- v1.0 (2024-03-24) - Initial roadmap based on existing documentation and progress

## Strategic Vision
A local vector database system that provides LLM coding agents with fast, efficient search capabilities for software projects via the Message Control Protocol (MCP).

## Success Metrics
- **Installation Success Rate**: 95%+ of users can install and run successfully
- **Query Performance**: <500ms for typical vector searches
- **Integration**: Support for major LLM tools (Claude, LLaMA, etc.)
- **Developer Experience**: Positive feedback from early adopters

## Timeline Overview
[Q1 2024] - Phase 1: Core Functionality (COMPLETED)
[Q2 2024] - Phase 2: Beta Release and Refinement (IN PROGRESS)
[Q3 2024] - Phase 3: Stable Release and Advanced Features (PLANNED)

## Phase 1: Core Functionality - [Q1 2024] âœ…
Building the foundational system components and essential features.

### Key Deliverables:
- âœ… Basic Vector Search - Completed
- âœ… MCP Interface - Completed
- âœ… File Indexing System - Completed
- âœ… Project Initialization - Completed
- âœ… Incremental Indexing - Completed
- âœ… Repository Structure Cleanup - Completed
- âœ… Installation Process - Completed

## Phase 2: Beta Release and Refinement - [Q2 2024] ðŸŸ¡
Preparing for and launching the v0.1.0 beta release.

### Key Deliverables:
- âœ… Comprehensive Documentation - Completed
- ðŸŸ¡ Test Suite Fixes - In Progress (80%)
- ðŸŸ¡ CI/CD Pipeline - In Progress (80%)
- ðŸŸ¡ Beta Release (v0.1.0) - In Progress (40%)
- ðŸ”´ Release Process - Not Started
- ðŸ”´ Versioning Strategy - Not Started

## Phase 3: Stable Release and Advanced Features - [Q3 2024] ðŸ”´
Incorporating beta feedback and adding advanced functionality.

### Key Deliverables:
- ðŸ”´ Advanced Filtering - Not Started
- ðŸ”´ Performance Optimization - Not Started
- ðŸ”´ IDE Integrations - Not Started
- ðŸ”´ Multi-modal Search - Not Started
- ðŸ”´ Stable Release (v1.0.0) - Not Started

## Risk Assessment
- **Dependency Changes**: Embedding models or MCP protocol might change - Monitor upstream projects regularly
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Vector search might be slow with very large codebases - Implement pagination and chunking
- **Installation Complexity**: Docker-based setup might be challenging for some users - Prioritize UX and documentation (Addressed in TASK-021)

## Next Priorities
1. Complete test suite fixes (TASK-012)
2. Fix CI pipeline issues (TASK-022)
3. Establish versioning strategy for beta release
4. Complete Beta Release preparations (TASK-018)
