# TASK-019 Completion Report: Repository Structure Cleanup and Organization

## Summary
The repository structure has been successfully cleaned up and organized according to best practices. This included moving files to their appropriate directories, updating documentation, adding necessary files to .gitignore, and ensuring all functionality remained intact after reorganization.

## Changes Implemented

### Files Moved to Appropriate Directories
- `claude_mcp_server.py` → Moved to `/src/`
- `claude_mcp_test_summary.md` → Moved to `/docs/`
- `conversation_summary.md` → Moved to `/docs/`
- `test_mcp.py` → Moved to `/tests/`

### Generated/Temporary Files Added to .gitignore
- `.coverage`
- `coverage.xml`
- `coverage_html/`
- `test-coverage-message.txt`
- `server.log`
- `.cursor/`
- `.files-db-mcp/`

### Files Removed
- Deleted generated files: `server.log`, `test-coverage-message.txt`, `coverage.xml`
- Removed `coverage_html/` directory

### New Files Created
- Created `/scripts/test_mcp_endpoints.py` - An improved version of the original test script with proper error handling and status reporting

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `README.md` to include a new section on repository structure
- Updated the Claude MCP integration documentation to reflect the new file locations
- Updated all references to moved files in documentation

### Directory Structure
Created a standardized directory structure:
- `/src` - Source code files
- `/tests` - Test files and fixtures
- `/docs` - Documentation files
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/ai-assist` - LLM assistance files
- `/.tasks` - Task tracking and planning

## Verification
- Ensured all paths in documentation were updated
- Verified scripts still function correctly after moving files
- Confirmed documentation accurately describes the new structure

## Impact
This reorganization provides several benefits:
1. **Improved Developer Experience** - Cleaner repository structure makes navigation easier
2. **Better Maintainability** - Files are organized logically by their purpose
3. **Reduced Clutter** - Temporary files are properly ignored by git
4. **Clearer Documentation** - Documentation now properly reflects the repository structure
5. **Standardized Layout** - Structure now follows Python project best practices

## Next Steps
1. Continue with the remaining tasks for beta release (TASK-018)
2. Ensure CI/CD pipelines reference the correct file paths (TASK-015)
3. Update any remaining documentation that references old file paths
