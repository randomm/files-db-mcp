## Versioning Strategy

Files-DB-MCP will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles:

- **v0.1.0** - First beta release
- **v0.x.y** - Subsequent beta releases (incrementing minor for features, patch for fixes)
- **v1.0.0** - First stable release

## Beta Testing Approach

1. **Internal Testing**
   - Test across different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Test with different project types and sizes
   - Perform stress testing with large codebases

2. **Controlled External Testing**
   - Select a small group of early adopters
   - Provide clear instructions and expectations
   - Establish feedback channels

3. **Public Beta**
   - Make GitHub repository public
   - Publish Docker images to Docker Hub
   - Enable GitHub Discussions for feedback

## Feedback Collection

- GitHub Issues for bug reports
- GitHub Discussions for feature requests and general feedback
- Optional telemetry for usage patterns and errors
- Regular check-ins with beta testers

## Success Criteria for Beta

1. **Stability**: No critical bugs in core functionality
2. **Usability**: New users can install and use without assistance
3. **Performance**: Meets or exceeds performance metrics in roadmap
4. **Documentation**: Complete and accurate for all features
5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Working and producing actionable feedback

## Post-Beta Roadmap

After beta release, focus will shift to:

1. Addressing feedback from beta testers
2. Completing Phase 3 features (Monitoring, Advanced Integrations)
3. Performance optimization based on real-world usage
4. Preparing for v1.0.0 stable release
