# Conversation Summary: Files-DB-MCP Project

## Project Overview
Files-DB-MCP is a local vector database system that provides LLM coding agents with fast, efficient search capabilities for software project files. It enables semantic understanding and retrieval of code through vector embeddings, accessible via the Message Control Protocol (MCP).

## Key Components
- **Vector Search Engine**: Core search functionality with semantic code understanding
- **File Watcher**: Real-time monitoring system for file changes
- **MCP Interface**: API layer following the Message Control Protocol
- **SSE Interface**: Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- **Claude MCP Integration**: Direct integration with Claude Code

## Current Test Coverage Status
- Overall test coverage: ~11.6% (as per coverage.xml)
- `vector_search.py`: ~77.6% coverage (best covered module)
- `claude_mcp.py`: 0% coverage (no tests)
- `file_processor.py`: 0% coverage (needs tests)
- `file_watcher.py`: 0% coverage (needs tests)
- `mcp_interface.py`: 0% coverage (needs tests)
- `sse_interface.py`: 0% coverage (needs tests)

## Recent Work
- Task-013 completed with improvements to test coverage:
  - Added comprehensive tests for file_watcher.py (100% coverage)
  - Enhanced SSE interface tests (coverage from 49% to 61%)
  - Overall test coverage increased from 45% to 69%

## Next Actions
- Created TASK-014 for improving Claude MCP integration test coverage
- Focus on modules with 0% coverage, particularly `claude_mcp.py`
- Aim for at least 75% coverage across all components

## Test Framework
- PyTest with pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Test organization follows unit/integration pattern
- Configuration in pyproject.toml with detailed linting rules

## Additional Observations
- Project has good test infrastructure but coverage is uneven
- Good testing patterns exist to follow in more complete test files
- Vector search component has strong test coverage to use as reference
