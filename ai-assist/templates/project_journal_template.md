## Sample Entry

```markdown
# Journal Entry: 2023-07-15

## Today's Focus
Implemented user authentication system and began work on the dashboard UI.

## Progress Made
- Completed JWT authentication backend
- Set up protected routes in the frontend
- Created basic dashboard layout with responsive design
- Added user profile component

## Decisions Made
- Using HttpOnly cookies for JWT storage: Provides better security against XSS attacks compared to localStorage
- Selected Material UI as the component library: Good documentation and community support, plus consistent design language

## Challenges Encountered
- CORS issues with the API: Resolved by updating the server configuration to accept requests from frontend origin
- React Context performance: Identified potential performance issues with current approach, need to research alternatives

## LLM Interaction Notes
- Worked with Developer LLM for authentication implementation
- Architecture LLM was very helpful in designing the auth flow
- Tester LLM created comprehensive tests for JWT validation
- The most effective prompt was providing a sequence diagram to the Architecture LLM

## Code Changes
- src/auth/AuthProvider.js: Created authentication context and provider
- src/api/authService.js: Implemented authentication API services
- src/components/Login.js: Built login form with validation
- src/components/Dashboard/: Created dashboard component structure

## Ideas & Insights
React Query might be a better solution for managing server state than our current custom hooks. It handles caching, loading states, and error handling more elegantly.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Complete user profile page
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Improve form validation with better error messages
- [ ] Research React Query

## Tips for Effective Journaling

1. **Be consistent**: Make daily entries even if they're brief
2. **Focus on decisions**: Document the "why" behind decisions for future reference
3. **Track LLM effectiveness**: Note which LLM roles and prompts worked best
4. **Review regularly**: Use weekly reflections to identify patterns and improvements
5. **Link to artifacts**: Reference specific files, commits, or documentation
6. **Note context switches**: Document when you switch between different parts of the project
7. **Capture code snippets**: Include important code snippets directly in the journal
8. **Update project context**: Use journal insights to update the project context file
