## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Prerequisite 1]
- [Prerequisite 2]
- [Prerequisite 3]

See `ai-assist/templates/dev_environment_setup.md` for detailed setup instructions.

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository URL]
cd [project directory]

# Install dependencies
[dependency installation commands]

# Set up local environment
[environment setup commands]

# Start the application
[startup commands]
```

### Access and Permissions

- **Repository Access**: Contact [Person/Team] to get access to the code repository
- **Development Environment**: Contact [Person/Team] for credentials
- **Production Access**: Contact [Person/Team] to request necessary permissions

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for new features
- **feature/[feature-name]**: Feature development branches
- **bugfix/[bug-name]**: Bug fix branches

### Development Process

1. Create a new branch from develop (or feature branch for sub-features)
2. Implement changes following project standards
3. Write tests to cover new functionality
4. Submit a pull request for code review
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge into the target branch after approval

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Provide a clear description of changes
- Reference related issues or tickets
- Include testing information
- Assign appropriate reviewers
- Ensure CI checks pass

### Code Review Process

- Reviewers should respond within [timeframe]
- Focus on code quality, correctness, and adherence to standards
- Use constructive and specific feedback
