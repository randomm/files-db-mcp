# AI Assistance Guidelines

This directory contains materials to help AI assistants effectively contribute to the project.

## Directory Structure

- `contexts/` - Specialized context files for different development tasks
- `prompts/` - Reusable prompts for common development tasks
- `templates/` - Templates for AI-generated content
- `guidelines/` - Guidelines for AI interactions and output formats
- `workflows/` - Workflow definitions for AI-assisted processes

## Usage for Solo Developers

These materials are designed to help you effectively coordinate multiple AI assistants in your development workflow:

1. Use `contexts/` to store project knowledge that can be shared across different AI sessions
2. Save successful prompts in `prompts/` for reuse with different assistants
3. Follow the guidelines in `guidelines/` to maintain consistency across AI interactions
4. Generate standardized artifacts using templates in `templates/`
5. Follow the structured workflows in `workflows/` for systematic project progress

See `docs/llm_devops_toolkit.md` for a comprehensive overview of the AI-assisted development approach.
