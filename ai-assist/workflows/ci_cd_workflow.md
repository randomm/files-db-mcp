# CI/CD Workflow Guide

This document provides guidelines for defining and maintaining CI/CD pipelines for the project.

## Pipeline Structure

### Stages Overview

1. **Build**: Compile code, generate assets, create containers
2. **Test**: Run automated tests (unit, integration, etc.)
3. **Security Scan**: Perform security analysis
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to target environments
5. **Verify**: Post-deployment verification
6. **Rollback**: Automated rollback if verification fails

### Environment Progression

- **Development**: Continuous deployment from feature branches
- **Staging**: Deployment after PR merge to main
- **Production**: Manual promotion from staging

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

- Store environment-specific configuration in environment variables
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use a secrets management solution for sensitive data

### Configuration Strategy

- Use a base configuration with environment-specific overrides
- Implement feature flags for staged rollouts
- Document all configuration options

## Test Automation

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Must pass before PR can be merged
- **Integration Tests**: Run after successful build
- **End-to-End Tests**: Run before deployment to staging/production
- **Performance Tests**: Run as a separate job on a schedule

### Test Reports

- Generate JUnit compatible reports
- Publish test coverage reports
- Trend test results over time

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

1. Deploy new version alongside the existing version
2. Run verification tests on the new version
3. Switch traffic to the new version when tests pass
4. Keep the old version available for quick rollback

### Canary Deployment

1. Deploy new version to a subset of infrastructure
2. Route a small percentage of traffic to new version
3. Gradually increase traffic if metrics are good
4. Complete rollout when confident

### Rollback Strategy

1. Automated rollback if health checks fail
2. Manual rollback option always available
3. Document rollback procedures

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Deployment Metrics

- Deployment frequency
- Deployment duration
- Failure rate
- Recovery time

### Health Checks

- Application health endpoints
- System resource utilization
- Error rates
- Response times

### Alerting

- Define alert thresholds
- Specify alert routing
- Document incident response procedures

## Security Integration

### Security Scans

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Container image scanning
- Secret detection

### Compliance Checks

- Policy as code
- Compliance reporting
- Audit logs

## Pipeline Templates

### GitHub Actions Workflow

### Azure DevOps Pipeline

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
    - main
    - develop

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - checkout: self
    - script: [...]
      displayName: 'Build'
    - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
      inputs:
        targetPath: [...]
        artifactName: 'build-artifacts'

- stage: Test
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
  - job: TestJob

        artifactName: 'build-artifacts'
    - script: [...]
      displayName: 'Run Tests'

    - script: [...]
      displayName: 'Security Scan'
    - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
      inputs:
        targetPath: [...]
        artifactName: 'security-report'

- stage: DeployStaging
  dependsOn:
  - Test
  - Security
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))

    environment: staging
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
            inputs:
              artifactName: 'build-artifacts'
          - script: [...]
            displayName: 'Deploy to Staging'

- stage: DeployProduction
  dependsOn: DeployStaging
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployProduction
    environment: production
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
            inputs:

```

## Best Practices

1. **Pipeline as Code**: Keep pipeline definitions in version control
2. **Idempotency**: Ensure pipeline steps can be safely rerun
3. **Immutability**: Build artifacts once and promote the same artifact
4. **Visibility**: Make pipeline status and logs easily accessible
5. **Documentation**: Document pipeline design and maintenance procedures
6. **Testing**: Test pipeline changes before applying to main branch
7. **Optimization**: Monitor and optimize pipeline performance
8. **Security**: Secure pipeline credentials and secrets

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep pipeline dependencies updated
2. **Performance Review**: Regularly analyze pipeline performance
3. **Cleanup**: Implement artifact retention policies
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor pipeline health and failures
5. **Documentation**: Keep pipeline documentation up to date
